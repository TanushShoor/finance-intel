# Ledger — AI Financial Document Analyst

Read a filing the way an analyst would, in seconds. Upload a 10-K / 10-Q, an earnings release, or a call transcript and Ledger ingests and structures it, extracts the financial metrics with period-over-period comparison, reads management's tone, pulls and categorises risk factors, benchmarks companies against each other, and drafts an investment memo — leaving you the judgment.

**Stack.** Backend: FastAPI + Google Gemini (`google-genai`, structured output) + SQLite (SQLModel). Frontend: React / Vite / TypeScript / Tailwind. Parsing: pdfplumber (PDF) and python-docx (DOCX), with a Docling fallback for scanned PDFs.

**Capabilities** (each maps to a graded success metric):

| Capability | What it does |
|---|---|
| Metric extraction | Extracts named figures (revenue, margins, EPS, cash flow, debt, guidance…) into a table with YoY/QoQ change |
| Management tone | Scores sentiment, confidence, and hedging; surfaces the most confident and most cautious passages |
| Risk factors | Extracts and categorises disclosed risks; diffs two periods to flag **new** / **escalated** risks |
| Competitor benchmarking | Side-by-side metric grid across companies, with comparative commentary |
| Investment memo | Company overview, financial summary, bull case, bear case, key risks, questions — grounded in the extracted data |

## Architecture

Document parsing feeds a single best-effort analysis pipeline; the result is stored as one JSON blob and rendered by the frontend. Cross-document features read those stored results.

**Key design points**

- **Chunked map-reduce structuring.** A large filing cannot be structured in one LLM call (the JSON response truncates). `ingestion/structure.py` splits the text (`ingestion/chunking.py`), parses each chunk into ordered blocks (the map), merges and de-duplicates overlap in code, then makes **one bounded call over the headings** to synthesize a clean title + outline (the reduce). This is the stage that streams the live chunk-progress animation.
- **Schema sanitizer.** Gemini's `response_schema` rejects JSON-Schema that Pydantic normally emits (`default` keys, `$ref`/`$defs` indirection, recursive schemas, `anyOf` null unions). `llm/schema.py:to_gemini_schema` rewrites any Pydantic model into a Gemini-safe schema; `llm/client.py` then parses the response back into the typed model. Every structured call goes through it.
- **Best-effort stages.** Each pipeline stage is wrapped so one failure (a bad chunk, a flaky call) degrades gracefully instead of sinking the whole analysis.
- **Ephemeral progress.** `pipeline/progress.py` is a thread-safe in-process store updated by the running background task and read by `GET /contracts/{id}`; it drives the frontend animation. (In-process by design — single-worker dev setup.)
- **Resilient startup.** On boot, any row left `processing`/`uploaded` by a restart is marked `failed`, so a reload never leaves a stuck "zombie" analysis.

### HTTP API

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `POST` | `/contracts` | Upload a filing (multipart) → returns id |
| `POST` | `/contracts/{id}/analyze` | Kick off analysis (background task) |
| `GET`  | `/contracts/{id}` | Status + live `progress` + `analysis` JSON |
| `GET`  | `/contracts` | List filings (id, company, period, doc_type, status) |
| `DELETE` | `/contracts/{id}` | Remove a filing |
| `POST` | `/benchmark` | `{contract_ids[]}` → metric grid + highlights |
| `POST` | `/compare/risk` | `{prior_id, current_id}` → risk-factor deltas |

## Workflow

End-to-end flow for analysing a single filing and then comparing across filings:

```
Browser (React)                    FastAPI                         Gemini · SQLite
──────────────                     ───────                         ───────────────
 choose file ──── POST /contracts ──────► save file + row(uploaded) ──────► SQLite
 (auto)     ──── POST /contracts/{id}/analyze ─► spawn background task: run_financial_analysis
 navigate to /contracts/{id}
 poll 2s   ──── GET /contracts/{id} ────► { status, progress, analysis }   ◄── progress store
    │  status = processing → <ChunkProgress> shows the current stage and,
    │                         during structuring, each parsed chunk rising in
    │  status = done       → render from analysis JSON:
    │                         · Dashboard  → metrics table + tone gauge + risk factors
    │                         · Memo       → overview / bull / bear / risks / questions
    │                         · Document   → synthesized outline + typeset body
 Benchmark page
   pick ≥2 filings ─ POST /benchmark ─────► grid assembled from each filing's stored metrics
                                            + one LLM call for comparative commentary
   pick prior+current ─ POST /compare/risk ► LLM diffs the two stored risk-factor sets
```

The analysis stages run **sequentially inside the background task**, so a large 10-K takes a few minutes (each chunk is a real Gemini call); short earnings releases finish quickly. The UI keeps polling and updates live.

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.13** — a virtualenv `legalvenv/` is already created at the repo root.
- **Node 20** — for the React frontend.
- **Google Gemini API key** — the free tier is sufficient for development.

## Setup

```bash
# 1. Backend dependencies
legalvenv/bin/pip install -r backend/requirements.txt

# 2. Configure the API key
cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
#    then set GEMINI_API_KEY in backend/.env  (GEMINI_MODEL defaults to gemini-2.5-flash)

# 3. Frontend dependencies
cd frontend && npm install
```

## Running

```bash
# Backend  → http://localhost:8000  (docs at /docs)
cd backend && ../legalvenv/bin/uvicorn app.main:app --reload

# Frontend → http://localhost:5173
cd frontend && npm run dev
```

CORS is open, so the frontend works on whatever port Vite picks.

## Usage

1. Open the frontend and go to **Filings**.
2. **Analyse a filing** — upload a PDF/DOCX. You're taken straight to the dashboard, which shows the live multi-stage progress (and the chunk animation during structuring).
3. When it completes: the **Dashboard** (metrics table, tone gauge, risk factors), plus the **Investment memo →** and **Document →** views.
4. **Benchmark** tab — select ≥ 2 analysed filings for the metric comparison grid, or pick a prior + current filing to diff their risk factors.

## Testing

```bash
cd backend && ../legalvenv/bin/pytest        # unit tests; Gemini is mocked, no API key needed
```

> Note: `eval/` and `fixtures/` are leftovers from the contract-analysis prototype this project was built on and are not wired to the current pipeline.

## Deployment

Ledger is a stateful, single-instance app (in-process progress + background tasks, SQLite, local uploads), so it deploys as **one backend process with a persistent disk** plus a static frontend. Docker artifacts (`backend/Dockerfile`, `frontend/Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`) and a slim `backend/requirements-prod.txt` are included. Full instructions — single-host Docker, managed split (Vercel + Render/Fly), TLS, and the scaling constraints — are in **[DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md)**.

```bash
GEMINI_API_KEY=your-key VITE_API_BASE=http://localhost:8000 docker compose up -d --build
# frontend → http://localhost:8080   backend → http://localhost:8000
```

## Document parsing & the Docling fallback

- **PDF** — pdfplumber extracts text page by page.
- **DOCX** — python-docx extracts paragraph text.
- **Scanned-PDF fallback** — if the text layer yields fewer than ~30 characters, the ingestion router retries with Docling (OCR + complex layouts). Docling is an optional heavy dependency; a clear error is raised if it isn't installed.
